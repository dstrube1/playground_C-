Introducing Events and Delegates

Events are mechanisms that enable objects to notify other objects when something happens. For example, controls on a web page or in a WPF user interface generate events when a user interacts with the control, such as by clicking a button. You can create code that subscribes to these events and takes some action in response to an event.

Without events, your code would need to constantly read control values to look for any changes in state that require action. This would be a very inefficient way of developing an application. In this lesson, you will learn how to create, or raise, events, and how to subscribe to events.

A delegate is a special type that defines a method signature; in other words, the return type and the parameters of a method. As the name suggests, a delegate behaves like a representative for methods with matching signatures.

Creating Events and Delegates

When you create an event in a struct or a class, you need a way of enabling other code to subscribe to your event. In Visual C#, you accomplish this by creating a delegate.  Once again, a delegate is a special type that defines a method signature; in other words, the return type and the parameters of a method. As the name suggests, a delegate behaves like a representative for methods with matching signatures. 


When you define an event, you associate a delegate with your event. To subscribe to the event from client code, you need to:

Create a method with a signature that matches the event delegate. This method is known as the event handler.
Subscribe to the event by giving the name of your event handler method to the event publisher, in other words, the object that will raise the event.
When the event is raised, the delegate invokes all the event handler methods that have subscribed to the event.

Suppose you create a struct named Coffee. One of the responsibilities of this struct is to keep track of the stock level for each Coffee instance. When the stock level drops below a certain point, you might want to raise an event to warn an ordering system that you are running out of beans. 

The first thing you need to do is to define a delegate. To define a delegate, you use the delegate keyword. A delegate includes two parameters:

The first parameter is the object that raised the event—in this case, a Coffee instance. 
The second parameter is the event arguments—in other words, any other information that you want to provide to consumers. This must be an instance of the EventArgs class, or an instance of a class that derives from EventArgs.
Next, you need to define the event. To define an event, you use the event keyword. You precede the name of your event with the name of the delegate you want to associate with your event.

The following example shows how to define delegates and events:

//Defining a Delegate and an Event
public struct Coffee
{
   public EventArgs e;
   public delegate void OutOfBeansHandler(Coffee coffee, EventArgs args);
   public event OutOfBeansHandler OutOfBeans;
}

In this example, you define an event named OutOfBeans. You associate a delegate named OutOfBeansHandler with your event. The OutOfBeansHandler delegate takes two parameters, an instance of Coffee that will represent the object that raised the event and an instance of EventArgs that could be used to provide more information about the event.

Raising Events

After you have defined an event and a delegate, you can write code that raises the event when certain conditions are met. When you raise the event, the delegate associated with your event will invoke any event handler methods that have subscribed to your event.

To raise an event, you need to do two things:

Check whether the event is null. The event will be null if no code is currently subscribing to it.
Invoke the event and provide arguments to the delegate.
For example, suppose a Coffee struct includes a method named MakeCoffee. Every time you call the MakeCoffee method, the method reduces the stock level of the Coffee instance. If the stock level drops below a certain point, the MakeCoffee method will raise an OutOfBeans event.

The following example shows how to raise an event:

// Raising an Event
public struct Coffee
{
   // Declare the event and the delegate.
   public EventArgs e = null;
   public delegate void OutOfBeansHandler(Coffee coffee, EventArgs args);
   public event OutOfBeansHandler OutOfBeans;
   int currentStockLevel;
   int minimumStockLevel;
   public void MakeCoffee()
   {
      // Decrement the stock level.
      currentStockLevel--;
      // If the stock level drops below the minimum, raise the event.
      if (currentStockLevel < minimumStockLevel)
      {
         // Check whether the event is null.
         if (OutOfBeans != null)
         {
            // Raise the event.
            OutOfBeans(this, e); 
         }
      }
   }
}

To raise the event, you use a similar syntax to calling a method. You provide arguments to match the parameters required by the delegate. The first argument is the object that raised the event. Note how the this keyword is used to indicate the current Coffee instance. The second parameter is the EventArgs instance, which can be null if you do not need to provide any other information to subscribers.

Subscribing to Events

If you want to handle an event in client code, you need to do two things:

Create a method with a signature that matches the delegate for the event.
Use the addition assignment operator (+=) to attach your event handler method to the event.
For example, suppose you have created an instance of the Coffee struct named coffee1. In your Inventory class, you want to subscribe to the OutOfBeans that may be raised by coffee1.

     Note: The previous topic shows how the Coffee struct, the OutOfBeans event, and the OutOfBeansHandler delegate are defined.

The following example shows how to subscribe to an event:

// Subscribing to an Event
public class Inventory
{
  public void HandleOutOfBeans(Coffee sender, EventArgs args)
   {
      string coffeeBean = sender.Bean;
      // Reorder the coffee bean.
   }
   public void SubscribeToEvent()
   {
      coffee1.OutOfBeans += HandleOutOfBeans;
   }
}

In this example, the signature of the HandleOutOfBeans method matches the delegate for the OutOfBeans event. When you call the SubscribeToEvent method, the HandleOutOfBeans method is added to the list of subscribers for the OutOfBeans event on the coffee1 object.

To unsubscribe from an event, you use the subtraction assignment operator (-=) to remove your event handler method from the event.

The following example shows how to unsubscribe from an event:

// Unsubscribing from an Event
public void UnsubscribeFromEvent()
{
   coffee1.OutOfBeans -= HandleOutOfBeans;
}

Module 9 Assignment

There is a starter project for you to use in the assignment.  Download it here.

[Mod_9_Homework.zip]

The demo for this unit showed how to create an event handler for the Create Student button.  If you have not watched the demo, do so now for an example of accessing the values in a GUI application.

The current project is very simple and only offers only a single event. Using the starter project, complete the following:

Add a new class to the project to represent a Student with three properties for the text fields.  (Feel free to copy your Student class from previous modules)
Create a collection to store Student objects (Use a List<T> for this assignment)
Implement the code in the button click event handler to create a Student object and add it to the collection
Clear the contents of the text boxes in the event handler  textbox.Text = ""; or textbox.Clear();
Using the form and button, create a number of Student objects and add them to the collection (at least 3)
There are two additional buttons on the form that can be used to move through a collection of students, (previous (<) and next (>) ).
Create event handlers for each of these buttons that will iterate over your Students collection and display the values in the text boxes
HINT: Use the syntax textbox.Text = <student property> for assigning the values from a Student object to the text boxes
NOTE: You only need to submit the MainWindow.xaml.cs file as that is where your logic resides for this exercise. You do NOT need to make any changes to the application form (MainWindow.xaml).  Visual Studio will update the xaml appropriately for the added events.  This assignment is only focused on the logic in your code.
Grading Criteria:

Event handler created for the Create Student button
Event handler creates a Student object using values from the text boxes on the form
Textbox values are cleared
Event handler adds a Student object to the List<T>
Next button displays each student's information in the text boxes
Previous button displays each student's information in the text boxes
Challenge:

Search on the properties of the buttons to learn how to disable the buttons if you are at the beginning or end of the collection.  Doing this prevents an unhandled exception if the button click attempts to access a value in the collection past the end or beginning.

Bonus challenge:

Instead of disabling the buttons, implement code in the next or previous events to cause the iteration to wrap around.  In other words, if you reach the last student in collection, a click of the "next" button should load the first student in the collection again so that the collection is listed again.  Do the same for the "previous" button.
