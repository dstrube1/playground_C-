  [0.13-0.3]
- Next features were ported from bsdftpd-ssl v0.5.0:
  Enhancement: support for RFC2228 and FTP-TLS draft (from 5th April, 2001)
  was added, but compatibility with previous FTP-SSL upgrade is still
  supported.
  Addition: command "prot" added for turning on/off encryption of data
  connections.
  Modification: TLS/SSL cipher messages now displayed in more verbose form,
  status information also was modified.
- Note: unlike ftps utility from bsdftpd-ssl distribution this implementation
  supports only next parameters for "-z" command-line option: secure, nosecure,
  tls and ssl.

  [0.13-0.2.1]
- Upper/lower case id mapping now works.

* 13 June 2001 Nick Leuta <skynick@stu.lipetsk.ru>
  [0.13-0.2]
- Bugfix release: many of bugs were fixed.
- Addition: changing modification time of downloaded files (if remote server
  supports MDTM command).
- Issue: connection lost if reply string from remote server contains symbol
  with 0xff code. Obtained with localized version of MS WinNT Workstation due
  to localized reply strings. May be fixed in future releases if needed.
- Issue: where is a problem with "proxy" (alternate connection) if main server
  connected via ssl. I can't investigate this issue currently because this
  feature today works with limited number of ftp servers. So don't use "proxy"
  if connected via ssl or use "ftps -z nossl" to disable ssl.
- Break: upper/lower case id mapping.
